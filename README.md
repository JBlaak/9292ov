NodeJS - 9292ov library
====

Library to communicate with 9292ov (9292ov.nl) for NodeJS.

Quite a bare start at the moment, but it allows you to get departures, locations and plan journeys.

Many thanks to https://github.com/timvanelsloo/9292-api-spec to put together the (otherwise) non-existant doc!

Have fun!
